                <p class="lead">
                    Stack is a robust, multipurpose template built with reuse and modularity at the core. Blending contemporary styling with beautiful markup, Stack forms the ideal starting point to website projects of any kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stack ships with over 140 content layouts, including 30 tailored niche homepages (from startup landing page to restaurant, portfolio and more) showcasing just a glimpse of what is possible with the detailed block and element library — from working social media feeds, contact forms and subscription blocks to fullscreen lightbox galleries and filterable portfolios, Stack is infinitely reusable, the ideal go-to template for your client projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of Stack’s 240+ interface blocks are powered by the vast collection of customisable elements. This modular system empowers developers to create their own blocks quickly and easily leaving more time for layout and interface experimentation.
